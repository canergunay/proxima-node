"""Push central VPN users down to the Proxima instances.

Every access row marked `pending` is created or updated on its instance, and
every row marked `pending_delete` has its remote account removed.

Ownership is split rather than exclusive. ADM decides who exists, where they
are authorized, and the limits; the user owns their own devices and may
change their own password from the client. So the push is authoritative for
every field *except* the password, which it carries only when ADM set it more
recently than the last push delivered one — see _password_is_ours.

Revocation deletes the remote account **with its peers**. A WireGuard peer
keeps working on its own keys regardless of whether the owning account still
exists — leaving the peers behind would mean "revoked" access that still
carries traffic. Use disable (enabled=0) when the intent is to suspend an
account without destroying its devices.
